# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build out a dashboard where participants in a belly button bacteria trial can find their unique ID number and see the results of the analysis of their own belly button. Using JavaScript's Plotly library, three charts are dynamically created based on the ID selected in the sidebar.

## Software

 - Javascript ES6
 - Plotly.js
 - HTML/CSS
